# UmbracoCMSDocs [WIP]

This is the new repository for articles and tutorials on Umbraco on .NET Core.

This is NOT the official documentation for Umbraco CMS. The official UmbracoDocs can be found on [github/UmbracoDocs](https://https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs) or on [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/).

## Reading and using the articles

It is **important to note** that this entire repository is a work in progress (WIP), which means that it will not contain a completed section of documentation for Umbraco.

All articles are divided into *topics* and each article can contain various *sub-topics*. All topics and sub-topics can be found under [Articles](Articles).

Each tutorial in the [Tutorials](Tutorials) folder has its own folder, in which multiple files and sub folders might also be found.
